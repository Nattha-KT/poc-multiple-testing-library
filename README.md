# Frontend Testing Libraries Comparison (PoC)

This monorepo demonstrates and compares different testing approaches in React applications. It serves as a Proof of Concept (PoC) for evaluating various testing libraries.

## Apps

1. **jest-app**: React app with Jest for unit testing
2. **vitest-app**: React app using Vite and Vitest for unit testing
3. **cypress-app**: React app with Cypress for E2E testing
4. **rtl-app**: React app with React Testing Library for component testing

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Run all apps in development mode
yarn dev

# Run all tests
yarn test

# Run specific app
yarn workspace @poc/jest-app dev
yarn workspace @poc/vitest-app dev
yarn workspace @poc/cypress-app dev
yarn workspace @poc/rtl-jest-app dev

# Run specific app's tests
yarn workspace @poc/jest-app test
yarn workspace @poc/vitest-app test
yarn workspace @poc/cypress-app test
yarn workspace @poc/rtl-jest-app test
```

## Testing Libraries Comparison

### Jest
**Pros:**
- Industry standard with large ecosystem
- Extensive mocking capabilities
- Great documentation and community support
- Fast parallel test execution

**Cons:**
- Configuration can be complex
- Slower than Vitest for large test suites
- Setup requires additional packages for React testing

### Vitest
**Pros:**
- Very fast execution
- Native ESM support
- Compatible with Jest's API
- Integrated with Vite

**Cons:**
- Newer with smaller ecosystem
- Some Jest plugins might not work
- Less battle-tested in production

### Cypress
**Pros:**
- Excellent debugging capabilities
- Real browser testing
- Great developer experience
- Visual test runner
- Built-in waiting mechanisms

**Cons:**
- Slower than unit tests
- More resource intensive
- Limited cross-origin testing
- More complex setup for CI

### React Testing Library
**Pros:**
- Encourages testing user behavior
- Simple, intuitive API
- Promotes accessibility
- Works well with Jest

**Cons:**
- Limited to component testing
- May need additional setup for complex scenarios
- Not suitable for E2E testing
- Learning curve for behavior-driven testing
